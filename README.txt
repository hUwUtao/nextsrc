What is this?

How to get?
simply clone this thing then npm install or yarn install

This is a source crawler tool for NextJS app (at least you can't if the app's developer shy about the code topology). Anyway, the usage is fcking simple, just:
    $ yarn crawl -o https://nextjs.org/
or
    $ npm run crawl -o https://nextjs.org/
whatever lmao, dont inject any sh1t or inject anything into the string, the tool itself is very unstable and not designed for handling sh1ts.
then 
    $ yarn unpkg
or
    $ npm run unpkg
to convert source file to readable JS/TS file (JSX and TSX works too!)

the result in the /out/ directory i guess hehe

Anyway I was lazy to write a serious guide XD
